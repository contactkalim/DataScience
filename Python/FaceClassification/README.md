# Face Classification Deep Learning Model using Keras on IMDB dataset 
Get dataset from- http://cvit.iiit.ac.in/projects/IMFDB/
The source has 2 parts - 
Part 1- To extract features from each image file on local system into a pickle dump as doing this part on Colab with G drive will take ages.
Part 2 - Build a simple CNN classifer on Colab to classify image expression as one among - 'NEUTRAL', 'SURPRISE', 'HAPPINESS', 'ANGER', 'DISGUST', 'FEAR', 'SADNESS'
Model accuracy is 36%.
