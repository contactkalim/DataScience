# Face Classification Deep Learning Model using Keras on IMFDB dataset 

Get dataset from- http://cvit.iiit.ac.in/projects/IMFDB/

The source has 2 parts - 

Part 1- FaceClassification__IMFDB_LocalSystem_Code.ipynb - To extract features from each image file on local system into a pickle dump as doing this part on Colab with G drive will take ages.

Part 2 - FaceClassification_IMFDB_Colab_Code.ipynb - Build a simple CNN classifer on Colab to classify image expression as one among - 'NEUTRAL', 'SURPRISE', 'HAPPINESS', 'ANGER', 'DISGUST', 'FEAR', 'SADNESS'

Model accuracy is 36%.
